# Pizza-Sales
This project involved analyzing pizza sales data to extract key business insights and trends using SQL and Power BI. The primary objectives were to monitor sales performance and identify top-selling items across different metrics. Key performance indicators (KPIs) calculated included Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, and Total Orders.

Key Insights and Analyses:

- Sales Trends: Daily and monthly trends for total orders were analyzed to understand peak sales periods and inform promotional strategies.
- Category and Size Analysis: Sales percentages by pizza category and size were calculated to understand customer preferences.
- Top and Bottom Pizzas: Identification of the top and bottom 5 pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders helped highlight bestsellers and underperformers.
  
This project provided valuable insights into customer purchasing patterns and product performance, aiding in data-driven decision-making for improved business outcomes.
